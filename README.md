Minimal Antshare paper wallet generator

# Why?

- Antshares uses an elliptic curve different from Bitcoin.
- Antshares, unlike other crypto-currencies, do not use the public key as the address.

Thus, many mainstream paper wallet generators do not support generating wallets for Antshares.

# What you need?

Your Antshares Address and Private Key.

**This is not a replacement to generate new Antshares Wallets. This merely helps you save them in a nice paper format**
